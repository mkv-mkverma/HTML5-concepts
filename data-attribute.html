<!-- The data-* attributes is used to store custom data private to the page or application. -->

<!-- Say you have an article and you want to store some extra information that doesnâ€™t have any visual representation -->
<!-- Issues
Do not store content that should be visible and accessible in data attributes, 
because assistive technology may not access them. In addition, 
search crawlers may not index data attributes' values. 

The main issues to consider are Internet Explorer support and performance. 
Internet Explorer 11+ provides support for the standard, but all earlier versions do not support dataset.
To support IE 10 and under you need to access data attributes with getAttribute()  instead. Also, the performance of reading data-attributes compared to storing this data in a JS data warehouse is poor.

That said, though, for custom element-associated metadata, they are a great solution.

In Firefox 49.0.2 (and perhaps earlier/later versions), 
the data attributes that exceed 1022 characters will not be read by Javascript (EcmaScript 4). -->
